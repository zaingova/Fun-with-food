## Usage

Once the user is signed in, they are redirected to the homepage, where they can select search parameters for dishes they might want to make. After clicking the "generate" button, a random dish with those parameters will appear on the right panel. The user can either click "save" to save that dish to their account, or they can check new search queries and generate a new dish.

To see a list of all saved dishes, the user can click on the center navigation icon. They will be redirected to a new page outlining each dish, with a dish name, dish description, dish image, and which allergens the dish contains. The user can click on the title of each dish to be redirected to the recipe.
